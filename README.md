Image Captioning Tool
Image Captioning stands at the intersection of image processing and natural language understanding. This assignment aims to describe the content of an image by using CNNs and RNNs to build an Image Caption Generator. It will be implemented using Pytorch & the dataset used is the Flickr 8k dataset.

Architecture
The model architecture consists of a CNN which extracts the features and encodes the input image and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based on Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) layers which acts as the decoder. The model uses the Resnet50 for encoding the input image.

ResNet-50 is a convolutional neural network that is trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database.

For Decoder we use LSTM. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a modified version of recurrent neural networks, which makes it easier to remember past data in memory. The vanishing gradient problem of RNN is resolved here.
